            <h3>What is a Yurt?</h3>
            <p>
              Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the
              ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden
              floor, and a rood dome that can be opened.

            <h3>How are the yurts finished</h3>
            <p>
              Each yurt is finished with a queen sized bed with down quilt and
              gas-fired stove. Your Luxury camping experience includes
              electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and
              restroom facilities are located at the lodge

            <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
            <p>

              changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful
              to bring a flahslight and a senese of adventrue!
